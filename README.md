# Exercise to test the context API of React

## General Features

This project was created using Vite and uses the dependency "Prop-types" for props checking

The main objective is to create a context that keeps track of a counter and then updates its value on every click of the button. The idea is to prove that all the components of the app have access to the context providing these components are children of the context provider

## Context reference

## Instructions

Fork the repo and provide the necessary code so that whenever the button is clicked, the count stored in the Counter Context is updated and shown in the other components
